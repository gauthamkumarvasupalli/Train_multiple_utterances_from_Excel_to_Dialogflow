# Train_multiple_utterances_from_Excel_to_Dialogflow
In this repo, I am sharing Nodejs code of how to train multiple Intents and utterances at once from an Excel sheet.

Steps:
1.Copy paste the Intents folder present in Dialogflow ZIP file into the folder where the Index.js is present.
2.Run the Index.js file
3. Select the excel file which is having Intents and utterances
4.It will update the utterances of Intents.
5.Now we can copy the Intents folder present in Index.js folder into Zip file of dialogflow.
6.Now we can import this zip file into dialogflow and save it.
done
